# Devopolis <br>

Devopolis is a social network created with the aim of bringing together developers who share the same interests, so that they can exchange experiences and participate in a community that encourages them to always evolve.

## About

This project was created during the Supervised Internship II discipline, with the collaboration of <a href="https://github.com/olucasgomes">Lucas Gomes</a>, my course colleague. <br>
The backend of this application was created using Node.js and some libraries of route configurations, database and access control. In this moment, the databse choosed was MongoDB Atlas, that offers us a quick and easy to implement solution.

If you want to test the application on your machine, just perform a 'clone' of this repository, or simply download both this repository, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/ricassiocosta/Devopolis-frontend/">frontend</a> repositories. Then just run the following codes:

<strong>yarn install</strong>
then
<strong>yarn start</strong>
